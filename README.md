# My macOS Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up a new macOS device. It includes a `Brewfile` with a comprehensive list of command-line tools and applications that I use for development, DevOps, and general productivity.

## üöÄ Installation

To set up a new device, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l2D/dotfiles_public/main/install.sh)"
```

This will clone the repository to `~/.dotfiles` and execute the setup script.

## üßê How It Works

The installation script (`install.sh`) performs the following steps:

1. **Clones the Repository**: It clones this repository to `~/.dotfiles` on your local machine. If the directory already exists, it will pull the latest changes.
2. **Executes the Setup Script**: It runs the `setup_my_new_device.sh` script, which:
    * Installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it's not already installed.
    * Installs all the packages, casks, and applications listed in the `Brewfile` using `brew bundle --global`.
    * Copies the configuration files (`.vimrc`, `.p10k.zsh`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to your home directory.
